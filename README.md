# TrustedBotIPs

**TrustedBotIPs** is a project designed to store and manage lists of IP addresses of trusted bots from reputable sources such as Google Search, Facebook, Bing, and others. The goal of this project is to provide a centralized database that makes it easy to track and validate legitimate bots crawling data from trusted services.

## Description

This project provides a well-organized directory structure to store bot IP lists. Each bot source has its own folder, with each source having a `.txt` file containing the list of IPs. Additionally, an aggregated file outside the source-specific folders will store all bot IPs in one place for easy access and use.
